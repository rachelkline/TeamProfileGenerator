## Description

  *The what, why, and how:*

  In this assignment, we were tasked with building a software engineering team generator comand line application using the Inquirer package. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. The assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will then create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the user-provided information.

  The employees are generated using a standard "Employee" class, then based on the user-input, they are then classified as either a Manager, Engineer, or Intern. Depending on the job title chosen, different questions will be prompted and appended to the HTML file.
  
  We were given free-reign for styling. In my example, I used my favorite video game characters (from the Legend of Zelda) and decided to build my color-schemes and fonts around that game!
